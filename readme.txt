Project Name: Descending Light
The game is a 2D pixelated horror game with zombies. 
The game concept is heavily influenced by shooter games 
involving the undead, such as The Lone Survivor: Director’s Cut, 
Zombocalypse, and Resident Evil. This game implements side scrolling 
with some action along with story-like elements. The main objective of 
the game is to navigate the building the main player is trapped in with 
limited resources and food. The game features 3 levels, 3 types of zombies, 
a boss battle, and navigating through a maze.
